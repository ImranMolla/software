## MongoDB

MongoDB (from humongous) is a cross-platform document-oriented database.
Classified as a NoSQL database, MongoDB eschews the traditional table-based
relational database structure in favor of JSON-like documents with dynamic
schemas (BSON format), making the integration of data in certain types of
applications easier and faster.
